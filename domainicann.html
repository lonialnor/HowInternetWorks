    <h2>DOMAIN</h2>
    <p>A domain name is simply the address to a website. If you think of the internet like a complex system of streets, then a domain name is like the address to a house. Every website has an IP address; an IP  address is a unique series of numbers. However, since people can’t remember seeming random sets of numbers, domain names were created. When you type an address into a search bar, for instance, your computer sends a request to a DNS server and in less than a second it tells your computer where to go. A domain name can be any combination of letters or numbers, and it can end in various domain name extensions: .com. .net, etc. A domain name must be registered before it can be used, no two domain names can be the same. When making a website it is essential for it to have a domain name so people can find it.
    </p>
    <h2>ICANN</h2>
    <p>ICANN stands for “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.” It is an American nonprofit organization that manages web addresses. It was established in 1998 to maintain the security and accessibility of the internet. When a domain name is registered a small fee is paid to ICANN. However, it is important to know that ICANN does not control what content goes on the internet. It does not regulate internet access or prevent spamming. By regulating domains ICANN allows for a global internet.
    </p>
    <p>ICANN is made of many different groups inside of it; they each represent a different part of the internet. For example, there are “supporting” groups for IP addresses, domain names, and country code top-level domains. Then there are “advisory committees” that represent governments and international treaty organizations, root server operators, internet security, and average Internet users. Lastly, there is a Technical Liaison Group; they work with organizations that make the basic protocols for Internet technologies.
    </p>
    <p>ICANN deals with the aforementioned domain names, but they are also involved with IP addresses and root servers. While ICANN does not run the IP Address system it does help coordinate how they are supplied to avoid repeats. A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet; there are only 13. They are rarely consulted, but they are essential to a functioning website. ICANN makes sure that the system is updated with the Internet.
