   <h2>W3C</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where people work together to develop Web standards. W3C gets its credibility through 3 sources. One, it was founded by the inventor of the web Tim Berners-Lee. Secondly, their memberships total over 300 members who are activelit in the IT and web industry. Thirdly, is their track record. W3C was named one of the most important organizations that has come from MIT.
    </p>
    <p>The W3C thrives off of collaboration. It increases competition and it increases the quality of the web. W3C brings different industries together and promotes conversations that can help the web. The more people who participate in the consortium then the better everything will get, business, quality, and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>Right now there are more than 90 standards that have passed through review. These standards are important because they make sure that the web works for everyone equally. For example, their standards for CSS ensure that every website works the same on any browser.
