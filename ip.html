    <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>An IP address is an exclusive number on all information technology devices such as: printers, routers, modems, etc. It identifies and lets them communicate with other devices in a computer network. There is a standard of communication called the Internet Protocol standard. It is basically like a home address.
    </p>
    <p>There are different types of IP Addresses: Dynamic and Static. Dynamic IP Addresses can change whenever. It comes from a pool of IP Addresses brought by an ISP or DHCP server. This one is best for when there are large amount of customers but they don't require the same address. Static IP Addresses never change. Most ISP’s (Internet Service Provider’s) have a single or block of static IP’s.
    </p>
    <h2>Packets</h2>
    <p>A packet is a small segment of a larger message. For example, data sent over the Internet is divided into packets; they are then put back together by the receiving machine. This is how it works. If a user needs to load a picture then the picture is divided into packets of data, then, once it is being received, it is reassembled.
    </p>
    <p>People use packets because it would take longer to transport files to multiple computers. That is where packet switching comes in. Packet switching is the ability of networking equipment to process packets without each other. It also lets packets take different routes to get to the same destination. Packets enable billions of devices to transmit data instead of a few.
    </p>
    <h2>Routing</h2>
    <p>The process of selecting a path across one or more networks is routing. It applies to a wide range of networks like telephones and mobile transportation. When it comes to packets they use routing to get to their destination. Routers make the internet routing decisions.
    </p>
    <p>Routing works by a router receiving a packet, determining where to route it based on routing tables, and then sending it on its way.
    </p>
    <p>Routing tables, what controls the path the packet takes, can also be static or dynamic. Static routing tables do not change and a network administrator usually sets it up. Dynamic routing tables are used for bigger networks.
