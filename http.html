    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It was created in the 1990’s and it allows web browsers and servers ro communicate. It is also called a “stateless system” because it enables connection on demand. A quick connection means the quicker data can be shown to the user. SInce it is an application layer protocol it is focused on presenting information, but not really about how it travels from one place to another. Sadly, this means that it can be intercepted and changed, thus making information vulnerable.
    </p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS is an extension of HTTP. The “s” stands for Secure. It is powered by Transport Layer Security, the standard security technology that makes an encrypted connection between the web server and the browser. When a user does not use HTTPS then they are in danger of any of their data entered into the site being taken. This includes usernames, passwords, credit card details, etc.
